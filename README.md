Hello! I am @BathingTime

I'm currently a grade 10 high school student. I have had over 4 years of coding experience. I learned Python for a majority of the time period and am quite
knowledgeable in it. I am currently learning Java and taking an AP computer science course. Despite my coding background, I still consider myself a novice
coder.

I am interested in computer science and technology. I specifically am planning to get into software development. Some other things I'm interested in is
video game development and media development. I also make random codes that solve very specific and random problems that I or my friends might have.

I would love to collaborate with others in big projects, but I can't do much other than write code in an IDE. Perhaps once I start learning more of the
technical stuff, then I could be useful. I am also happy with making or collaborate with any code for others' random ideas.
