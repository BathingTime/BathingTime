Hello! I am @BathingTime

I'm currently a grade 10 high school student. I have had over 4 years of coding experience. I learned Python for a majority of the time period and am quite knowledgeable in it. I am currently learning Java. Despite my coding background, I still consider myself a novice coder.

I am interested in computer science and technology. I specifically am planning to get into software development. Some other things I'm interested in is video game development and media development. I also make random codes that solve very specific and random problems that I or my friends might have.
